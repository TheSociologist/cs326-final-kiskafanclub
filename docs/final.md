Conclusion - In the beginning of the project, we struggled to find our footing and in finding a solid idea for our project. 
Using bootstrap for the design process immensely helped us visualize what kinds of designs would and wouldn't work.
We feel that we would have preferred having a better background on the backend side of things as it would have
greatly helped us structure the workflow during backend development. Overall, working on this group project has given us 
experience on how working on a huge project in a group setting is like and it also gave us an idea on how large websites are generally built.
