# Innovative Idea
App where high school students seek information/advice about colleges and the college application process. High school students are connected to college student volunteers. Can motivate college students to volunteer with some sort of ranking system (most hours volunteered, most students helped). May also try to incentivize participation with ad revenue. College student volunteers may offer one on one help (college essays, more information about extracurriculars, a specific school, a specialty), or group QA sessions. Weâ€™ll try to find some zoom API for meetings and maybe some kind of LinkedIn API so high school students can view college student profiles and see who they want to meet with. Can also expand the idea to job search (college students to employees of companies where employees are the volunteers). 

Also if volunteers set up profiles on the app or connect their linkedins, (and high school students do the same), we could use some kind of stable matching to match students with volunteers based on profile data.
