# Innovative Idea
App where high school students seek information/advice about colleges and the college application process. High school students are connected to college student volunteers. Can motivate college students to volunteer with some sort of ranking system (most hours volunteered, most students helped). May also try to incentivize participation with ad revenue. College student volunteers may offer one on one help (college essays, more information about extracurriculars, a specific school, a specialty), or group QA sessions. Weâ€™ll try to find some zoom API for meetings and maybe some kind of LinkedIn API so high school students can view college student profiles and see who they want to meet with. Can also expand the idea to job search (college students to employees of companies where employees are the volunteers). 

Also if volunteers set up profiles on the app or connect their linkedins, (and high school students do the same), we could use some kind of stable matching to match students with volunteers based on profile data.

### Description
The dashboard provides users with a list of recent and trending question and answer posts from the colleges they're following. Within the desktop view, there are sidebar elements that provide quick links to recommended and ongoing content. On the left this includes a list of recommended colleges based off the user's followed colleges. We can implement a basic query to match tags and certain stats about colleges to come up with recommendations. Additionally, there are a list of recommended q&a posts from colleges the user is not following. This can be found using similar systems as before. On the right are quick links to currently live zoom sessions. We can use HTTP long polling or websockets to keep this list consistently updating or just fallback to the stated times for the meetings.

### Description
The colleges page gives users the ability to discover and compile colleges using filters and sorts. We hope this provides a more fine-grained way to look for colleges according to user preferences. Right now our ideas for filters include admission difficulty, majors required, sorting based on rankings according to US news or other sources, and location. We may add more if time allows.

### Description
The menu bar is the top-most website navigation system on the platform. It includes website details including an icon and title and links to each top-level page including home, collges, and the signed in user's profile and settings (within a dropdown). There's also a searchbar on the right that can be used to look for colleges, other users, questions, and meetings.
